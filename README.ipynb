    "From 2013 - 2020 I lived in Melbourne, FL without a car; and for those 7 years I pretty much walked to every spot in the 32901/32905 zip code. Grocery stores, check; The Mall, check; College, check; Downtown, check; The Gym, check; Restaurants, check; Barber Shop, check; Places that shouldn't be listed, check. \n",

    "The height of my walking took place in the last two years when I was teaching at Palm Bay HS. The public bus to take me to the school came ONCE every hour at an inconveient time either getting me to work too early or too late. Even worse the routes were not symmetrical and the bus couldn't take me back home. So the solution was to walk in the Florida heat everyday for two years.\n",

    "Moving back home in 2020, I discovered New York City's bike sharing program, CitiBike, and wished I had this service during my time in Florida. Even better, I am \"fortunate\" enough to live in a zip code that <b>doesn't</b> have bikes. So out of wishful thinking and an accidental ingredient of pure jealously, the Bike Share USA project was born. "

    "Every major human advancement improved how people, things, or ideas moved from one point to another. Ancient innovations such as agriculture, providing us with a surplus of food, enabled us to stop moving and build civilizations. Present day innovations such as the Internet has taken movement to all new levels. Leveraging the internet, you can order a package and have it delivered by day end or you can send software money, permissionlessly, from one end of the world to another. More so, the internet enables the global movement of information at near instant speeds. \n",

    "When it comes to the physical transportation of people, intra-planet space travel and self-driving cars are the talk of the town. However, the greatest macro transportation revolution is happening on a micro level.  Micromobility refers to a range of small, lightweight vehicles operating at speeds typically below 15-mph and driven by users personally. Micromobility devices include, bicycles, e-bikes, electric scooters and skateboards, shared bicycles, and electric pedal assisted bicycles <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromobility\" target=\"_blank\"> [1]</a>. \n",
    "         \n",
    "According to the 2019 Shared Micromobility Snapshot, published by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), the number of trips taken on shared bicycles, e-bikes, and scooters was 136 million; up 60% from 2018’s 84 million and 288% from 2017’s 35 million <a href=\"https://nacto.org/shared-micromobility-2019/\"> [2]</a>.  Although there is not any official data about transportation mode shifting, their survey data suggests that Micromobility might be replacing car trips. The United States (US) has about 19,495 incorporated cities, towns, and villages and of those, 310 are considered at least medium cities with populations of 100,000 or more <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-city-rankings/how-many-cities-are-in-the-us\"> [3]</a>. Looking at the NACTO map there are only about 130 cities that have micromobility services. Imagine if there were micromobility services in all 310 of those cities. Better yet, imagine every part of the United States having micromobility services and instead of a sparse map the shared micromobility map resembled a Verizon 4G LTE Coverage map. \n",
    "         <p style=\"text-align:center;\"> <b>The goal of this project is to expand the station-based bike sharing sector of a State's micromobility services. The idea is to use both zip code and bike sharing data of areas that have stations to build a model that can predict the number of stations that should be built in no-station zip codes. The question that this project is looking to answer is: How many bike sharing stations should be built in the zip codes that already have bike stations within the States of: CA, MA, D.C., MD, VA, NJ, NY, and IL?</b> </p> \n",

    "The subset of zip codes that have bike stations are derived from the five largest bike sharing services in the US: Bay Wheels, Blue Bike, Capital Bikeshare, Citi Bike, and Divvy Bike. Each company hosts their trip data on S3 buckets for public use. These datasets hold key information about each trip that was taken by their customers. The rows of the datasets represent a single trip; the columns are the properties of the trip such as the starting station and the time when the trip ended. Since the trip data includes the start and end stations, the station data used to make the predictions was derived from these datasets.\n",

Leveraging the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud a RDS Database running PostgreSQL 12.5 was created on a db.t3.micro instance. With the blank database created, before doing anything, it was important to think about how the data was going to be used for analytics; to determine how it should be feed into the database.
