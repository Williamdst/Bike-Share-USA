    "Things to Mention\n",
    "- All the trips that are slightly above 1.5 hrs aren't necessarily invalid trips. However, the trips that have a high likelihood of being invalid are above 1.5 hrs. Why? Citibike isn't a service targetted towards long distance rides, which can be seen in their pricing models. The annual membership allows unlimited rides that are capped at 45m. Their day pass allows unlimited rides that are capped at 30m. And a single ride is 3 for 30m. With these finacial thresholds in place, it makes sense why the majority of trips are beneath them. In fact, there is no incentive for a person to keep a bike out for significantly longer than the threshold. If you need the bike for 90m than an as annual rider you park the bike at 45m and then take another bike for the other 45m and not have to pay the extra 6.75 (unless you rode to a place where there aren't any stations to park or the stations have very limited bikes and you don't want to risk your bike being taken and being stranded).\n",
    "- The data is 'sensitive' to quantile changes. Example the 99.5th quantile is 94m the 99th is 62m and the 98th is 46m.\n",
    "- *Although there is only one sample of 1M rows taken, no matter how many times you sample from all the trips the lower quantile is 1 and the upper quantile is close to 96. The reason that I ommitted the many times I sampled was because sampling takes a long time to execute*"
