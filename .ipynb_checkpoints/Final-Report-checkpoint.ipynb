    "Every major human advancement improved how people, things, or ideas moved from one point to another. Ancient innovations such as agriculture, providing us with a surplus of food, enabling us to stop moving and build civilizations. Present day innovations such as the Internet has taken movement to all new levels. On top of the back of the internet you can order a package and have it delivered by day end. On top of the back of the internet you can send software money, permissionlessly, from one end of the world to another. Most importantly, the internet enables the global movement of information at near instant speeds. \n",

    "When it comes to the physical transportation of people, intra-planet space travel and self-driving cars are the talk of the town. However, the greatest macro transportation revolution is happening on a micro level.  Micromobility refers to a range of small, lightweight vehicles operating at speeds typically below 15 mph and driven by users personally. Micromobility devices include, bicycles, e-bikes, electric scooters and skateboards, shared bicycles, and electric pedal assisted bicycles [1]. "

    "   <p>According to the 2019 Shared Micromobility Snapshot, published by the National Association of City Transportation Officials (NACTO), the number of trips taken on shared bikes, e-bikes, and scooters was 136 million up 60% from 2018’s 84 million and 288% from 2017’s 35 million [2].  Although there is not any official data about transportation mode shifting, their survey data suggests that Micromobility might be replacing car trips. The United States has about 19,495 incorporated cities, towns, and villages and of those, 310 are considered at least medium cities with populations of 100,000 or more [3]. Looking at the NACTO map there are only about 130 cities that have micromobility services. Imagine if there were micromobility services in all 310 of those cities. Better yet, imagine every part of the United States having micromobility services and instead of a sparse map the shared micromobility map resembled a 4G LTE Coverage map. \n",
