    "The goal of this notebook is to get all the required data needed to complete the project. The first dataset that will be compiled is the Trip data from CitiBike. The trip data holds key information about each trip that was taken by customers of the service. For example, columns such as the start time, end station, and gender are recorded for each trip.\n",

    "The next dataset that is needed is the characteristics of each neighborhood in New York City (NYC). The data was gathered by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University. Each dataset has different categories of information about each neighborhood in the city. For example two categories that exist in the dataset are demographics and housing. \n",

    "The third data is GeoJSON data that actually segments the community districts of NYC. That data is obtained directly from NYCOpenData. *Note: What Furman Center calls Neighborhoods, NYCOpenData calls Community Districts.
