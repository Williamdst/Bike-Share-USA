    "The stations that exist in the system is always changing. CitiBike adds new stations, removes stations, and occasionally moves stations to nearby locations. In this section we are going to add two new columns to the 'station' table called birth and death. The birth column will represent the date of the first trip that was taken from the station. The death column represents the date of the last trip that was taken from the station. Stations are considered dead if there wasn't a trip within the last month. Any station that is still active will have a null value in the death column."
